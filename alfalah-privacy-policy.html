    <!-- WAITING LIST -->
    <h3>Waiting List</h3>
    <p>
        No timescale can be given as to how long it will take for the child to be enrolled into the school, and places 
        are allocated on a first come first serve basis. Once a place is offered and the parent thereafter requests a 
        different time to what was specified, the place will be offered to the next applicant.
    </p>

    <!-- APPLICATION FORM -->
    <h3>Application Form</h3>
    <p>
        When parents complete the application form, they should indicate if the student has any medical conditions, 
        allergies, or takes any regular medication. The madrassa should be kept informed of any changes after the 
        student has been enrolled, such as phone numbers and address.
    </p>

    <!-- ARRIVAL -->
    <h3>Arrival</h3>
    <p>
        The parent/guardian agrees to ensure the child comes to school on time, and they arrive 5–10 minutes before class 
        starts. The school reserves the right to remove a student from the register for continuous tardiness.
    </p>

    <!-- ATTENDANCE -->
    <h3>Attendance</h3>
    <p>
        Attending the school regularly and on time is the responsibility of both the parent and student. The school 
        expects students to attend all classes. Parents must inform the school as early as possible if a student is 
        unable to attend.
    </p>

    <!-- HOLIDAYS -->
    <h3>Holidays</h3>
    <p>
        Madrassa will give holidays during all the major Islamic events throughout the year. There will also be some 
        holidays offered during the breaks in the academic school year to allow parents to spend time with children 
        and go away on holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Madrassa may choose to close due to unexpected circumstances such as severe weather conditions. In such 
        situations parents will be notified by email.
    </p>

    <!-- BEHAVIOUR -->
    <h3>Behaviour</h3>
    <p>
        Madrassa gives high value to behaviour of our children and under no circumstances will we accept any sort of 
        unacceptable conduct which may cause inconvenience to our staff, teachers, or other students. Strict disciplinary 
        actions will be taken against such students and may even lead to withdrawal of students from the school.
